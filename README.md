If you are interested to reproduce the figures from "**Leveraging chromatin state transitions for the identification of regulatory networks orchestrating heart regeneration**" Published in Nucleics Acids Research (2024).<br />
All you need to do is to download the repository and run the Scripts. I added the main Input files from each figure, in order to use them.
